Commentari comes from the Latin deponent verb commentārī: to think carefully, to meditate, to sketch with words. In the spirit of the great tech blogs of the pre-SEO internet, this isn’t a place for polished treatises but for working through ideas in public.


My technical life is in Rust and Go, increasingly at the seams where languages, FFIs, and libraries like Arrow meet. I had the privilege to build dbt Core for 3 years and now work fulltime on the dbt Fusion engine.


I often detour into mathematical logic, ancient languages, modern languages, and the ethics of Socratic and Hellenistic thinkers — threads from my college years that continue to weave into my engineering practice.
